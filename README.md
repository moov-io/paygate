## Contributing

TODO(adam): contrib and CoC docs
Yes please! Please review our [Contributing guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to get started!

Note: This project uses Go Modules, which requires Go 1.11 or higher, but we ship the vendor directory in our repository.

### Test Coverage

Improving test coverage is a good candidate for new contributors while also allowing the project to move more quickly by reducing regressions issues that might not be caught before a release is pushed out to our users. One great way to improve coverage is by adding edge cases and different inputs to functions (or [contributing and running fuzzers](https://github.com/dvyukov/go-fuzz)).

Tests can run processes (like sqlite databases), but should only do so locally.

Each PR should increase the overall coverage, if possible. You can run `make cover-test` to save a coverage profile and `make cover-web` to open the HTML view in your default browser.
