## Configuration

PayGate uses a file based config for modifying the default way it operates. Various settings can be changed with this file which is written in [YAML format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML). Key names are case-insensitive.

Use the command-line flag `-config <filename>` for specifying where to read this file from.

Generic placeholders are defined as follows, but typically real-world examples are used. Brackets indicate that a parameter is optional. For non-list parameters the value is set to the specified default.

* `<address>`: a with scheme, host and port that parses as a URL
* `<base64-string>`: a Base64 encoded string
* `<boolean>`: a boolean that can take the values `true` or `false`
* `<duration>`: a duration matching the regular expression `[0-9]+(ms|[smhdwy])`
* `<filename>`: a valid path in the current working directory
* `<host>`: a valid string consisting of hostname or IP followed by an optional port number
* `<number>`: a 32-bit number, but typically only positive values
* `<scheme>`: a string that can take the values `http` or `https`
* `<string>`: a regular string
* `<secret>`: a regular string that is a secret, such as a password
* `<tmpl-string>`: a string which is template-expanded before usage
